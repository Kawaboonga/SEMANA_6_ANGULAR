muestran en el carrusel.\nLa idea es tener una interfaz flexible que permita reutilizar el mismo\ncomponente visual para distintos tipos de contenido sin duplicar código.\nEl carrusel utiliza este modelo para decidir:\n\nqué mostrar,\n\ncómo mostrarlo,\n\nqué campos opcionales incluir según el tipo.\n\nLos campos opcionales se muestran solo si el tipo de item lo requiere.\n\nMantener este modelo genérico hace que agregar nuevos tipos de contenido\nal carrusel sea mucho más simple.\n\nbadge es útil para destacar “Nuevo”, “Oferta”, “Recomendado”, etc.\n\nctaLabel y ctaLink permiten usar el carrusel como una zona de acción.\n\n\nExample :const item: CarouselItem = {\n  id: 'p1',\n  type: 'product',\n  title: 'Fender Stratocaster',\n  imageUrl: '/assets/img/products/strato.jpg',\n

flexible que permita reutilizar el mismo\n * componente visual para distintos tipos de contenido sin duplicar código.\n *\n * El carrusel utiliza este modelo para decidir:\n * - qué mostrar,\n * - cómo mostrarlo,\n * - qué campos opcionales incluir según el tipo.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * - Los campos opcionales se muestran solo si el tipo de item lo requiere.\n * - Mantener este modelo genérico hace que agregar nuevos tipos de contenido\n *   al carrusel sea mucho más simple.\n * - `badge` es útil para destacar “Nuevo”, “Oferta”, “Recomendado”, etc.\n * - `ctaLabel` y `ctaLink` permiten usar el carrusel como una zona de acción.\n *\n * @example\n * const item: CarouselItem = {\n *   id: 'p1',\n *   type: 'product',\n *   title: 'Fender Stratocaster',\n *   imageUrl: '/assets/img/products/strato.jpg',\n *   price: 680000,\n *   ctaLabel: 'Ver producto',\n *   ctaLink: '/productos/fender-strato'\n * };\n */\nexport interface CarouselItem {\n  id: string;\n  // ID

cualquier elemento\nsobre el que se use el atributo appFadeUp.\nFuncionamiento:\n\nInicialmente deja el elemento con opacity: 0 y translateY(12px).\nCuando el elemento entra en el viewport, anima a opacity: 1 y translateY(0).\nUsa IntersectionObserver para detectar la entrada en pantalla.\nIncluye un fallback con setTimeout para evitar que el contenido\nquede invisible si el observer falla o se retrasa.\n\nExample :\n\n  Sección animada\n  Este contenido se desvanece hacia arriba al entrar en pantalla.\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n

página de productos.\n *\n * Este modelo centraliza todos los filtros del listado para evitar\n * estar manejando variables sueltas o estados dispersos.  \n * Cada propiedad es opcional para que el usuario pueda combinar filtros\n * libremente (categoría + rango de precio + condición + orden, etc.).\n *\n * Se usa en:\n * - la barra de búsqueda,\n * - filtros laterales,\n * - sliders de precio,\n * - ordenamiento del listado,\n * - y en cualquier componente que necesite filtrar productos.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * - Si agregas nuevos filtros visuales, defínelos también aquí.\n * - `category` y `condition` incluyen la opción `'todos'` para resetear filtros.\n * - Mantener este modelo limpio ayuda a que manejar la UI sea mucho más simple.\n *\n * @example\n * const filtros: ProductFilter = {\n *   searchTerm: 'Fender',\n *   category: 'guitarras',\n *   minPrice: 100000,\n *   condition: 'usado',\n *   sortBy: 'priceAsc'\n * };\n */\nexport interface ProductFilter {\n
